        <div id="coursedesc">
          <p>
            Python is one of the leading programming languages for scientific research, data science, and machine learning. The course will familiarize students with the Python scientific stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, and best practices for scientific computing. <br>
            Every class will present a scientific problem, a method for solving it, and an implementation in Python. Examples will include how to model the spread of infectious diseases, find stationary points for a predator-prey equation system, identify an object in an image, calculate the extinction probability of a rare mutation, analyze results of a tennis game, and plot a map of hurricane density.

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="spanh">Programming skills</span><br>
        All class lectures and assignments will be in Python 3 and use the Python scientific stack. 
        We'll dedicate the first classes to provide an introduction to Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
        <br>
        If you have programming experience but in a different language (e.g. Java/C/C++/Matlab/Javascript/Ruby/Perl/R) you will probably be fine, just go over a tutorial before the first class.
        </li>
        <li><span class="spanh">Undergraduate Calculus &amp; Linear Algebra</span><br> You should be comfortable with differentiation, integration, and matrix and vector operations and notation.</li>
        <li><span class="spanh">Basic Probability and Statistics</span><br>You should be familiar with basics of probability theory (e.g. Bayes' theorem, law of large nubmers, central limit theorem), the characteristics of basic distributions (e.g. uniform, Poisson, Gaussian), and basic statistical operations (e.g. mean, standard deviation, variance).</li>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>  
    <div class="qqa">
      <div class="qq">Can I audit or sit in?</div>
      <div class="qa">In general we are very open to sitting-in guests if you are a member of the IDC community (student, postdoc, staff, and/or faculty). We ask that you talk to the instructor before the first class you attend. If the class is too full and we're running out of space, we would ask that you please allow registered students to attend.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qqa">
      <div class="qq">Can I do the assignments or the final project in groups?</div>
      <div class="qa">No, you may not. See more details about the <a href="/project">Final Project</a></div>
    </div>
    <div class="qqa">
      <div class="qq">I have a question about the class. What is the best way to reach the course staff?</div>
      <div class="qa">Almost all questions should be asked on <a href="https://piazza.com/idc.ac.il/fall2018/scicompy">Piazza</a>. If you have a sensitive issue you can email the instructor directly.</div>
    </div>
    <!-- <div class="qqa">
      <div class="qq">Can I combine the Final Project with another course?</div>
      <div class="qa"> Yes, you may; however before doing so you must receive permission from the instructors of both courses.</div>
    </div> -->
    <div class="qqa">
      <div class="qq">What do the home assignments look like?</div>
      <div class="qa"> Assignments are given as a Jupyter notebooks and require writing Python code to complete one or more computational tasks.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qqa">
      <div class="qq">What is the balance between theory and application in the course?</div>
      <div class="qa"> When possible, lectures will include the theoretical background for the models and methods that will be used. Of course, when deep understanding requires advanced mathematics or statistics, or very specific scientific knowledge, students will be reffered to the literature.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="qqa">
    <div class="qq">Where can I find additional resources on scientific computing with Python?</div>
    <div class="qa"> Cyrille Rossant maintains a <a href="https://github.com/rossant/awesome-scientific-python" target="_blank">curated list of awesome scientific Python resources</a> on GitHub. <br>
    Kaggle hosts a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kernels" target="_blank">library of machine and deep learning notebooks</a>. <br>
    QuantEcon hosts an <a href="http://notes.quantecon.org" target="_blank">open notebook library for economic modeling</a>. <br>
    Claus O. Wilke's online preview of the <a href="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/" target="_blank">Fundamentals of Data Visualization</a> is a great "guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional." <br>
